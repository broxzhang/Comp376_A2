# Title: Underground Mystery

## Gameplay: Dialogue-based Investigation + Shooting Mechanism

## Inspired by: Danganronpa

### Game Mechanics:

1. Dialogue with NPCs:

    * Players will initiate conversations with 5 different NPCs.
    * Each NPC conversation follows a layered structure: 1 - 2 - 4.
    * Through these conversations, players can gather evidence and abilities to aid them in the next phase of the game.
2. Evidence NPCs:

    * There are 3 NPCs who provide evidence.
    * Depending on the NPC's dialogue, players might receive:
        * Useful evidence
        * Irrelevant evidence
        * Evidence with negative effects
3. Ability NPCs:

    * 2 NPCs grant players unique abilities.
        * Ability 1 - Quick Thinking: Enhances the player's ability to think rapidly.
        * Ability 2 - Insight: Allows the player to see through falsehoods and identify the truth.
4.  Confrontation Phase:

    * Players have three chances to confront the suspect.
    * In each round, the suspect's statements will appear as 5 separate floating bullets on a specific part of the screen.
    * Players will use their gathered evidence as ammunition to shoot down these statements within a given time limit.
        * Evidence efficacy varies:
        * Useful evidence can break a statement in one hit.
        * Irrelevant evidence requires 3 hits.
        * Negative evidence requires 10 hits.
5. Ability Usage:

    * Quick Thinking:
        * Positive: Extends the time limit for shooting down statements.
        * Negative: Reduces the time limit.
        * No ability: No change in the time limit.
    * Insight:
        * Positive: Correct evidence bullets will turn red.
        * Negative: All evidence bullets become gray and hard to read.
        * No ability: Evidence bullets appear in standard black font.
        
        
6. Game Outcome:
    
    * Players have to succeed in at least one of the three confrontation rounds to win the game.
    * If they fail in all three rounds, the game ends in a loss.
7. Post-Game Summary:

    * After the game concludes, a summary will be displayed.
    * This summary will showcase the types of evidence the player collected and the abilities they acquired or missed.

#### Objective: Use the gathered evidence and abilities wisely in three confrontations to reveal the truth behind the Underground Mystery!
